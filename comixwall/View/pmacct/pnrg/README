PNRG, the pmacct's Network Resource Grapher

PNRG is a package for maintaining and visualizing network data, particularly
suited for historical trend analysis of network resources. PNRG doesn't need
any explicit configuration and is able to auto-discover, mantain and graph
new resources (either IPv4/IPv6 end hosts, network segments, MAC addresses,
Autonomous Systems, etc.) as soon as they produce a traffic footprint. 

PNRG at a glance:
* Easily displays network data collected through pmacct, regardless of the
  data source, ie. the network itself, NetFlow or sFlow.
* From a couple of pmacct's memory plugins straight to your preferred web
  browser, without the need to configure or define anything. 
* No need to rotate, mantain or update anything once the package is in place.  
* Just a working installation of pmacct, RRDtool and an Apache supporting
  execution of CGIs are required.

While it has been over-simplified, specifically tailored to network usage and
written from the scratch, most of its concepts are deeply rooted inside the
NRG project ( http://nrg.hep.wisc.edu/ ). For the task, PNRG gets data from
a couple of pmacct's memory plugins and relies over RRDTool for graphs and
CGIs.
