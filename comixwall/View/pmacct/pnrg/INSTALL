pnrg is Copyright (C) 2006 by Pedro Sanchez

1. Prerequisites

a) A working pmacct installation. pnrg interacts only with pmacct client and
   expects to find it as /usr/local/bin/pmacct
   http://www.pmacct.net/

b) A working RRDtool installation. pnrg interacts with both rrdtool exec and
   rrdcgi. It expects to find a RRDtool installation under /usr/local/rrdtool
   http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/

c) A working web server with support for CGIs. Apache is highly recommended.
   pnrg doesn't interact in any way with the web server, but in order to work
   correctly, it's expected the spool directory to be browseable (and because
   of the CGIs, executable aswell) by a web browser. 
   http://httpd.apache.org/


2. Installation and configuration

a) after unpacking pnrg's tarball, copy all its content under /usr/local/pnrg
   By default the package expects to run under such path. 

b) launch your pmacct daemon (ie. either pmacctd, nfacctd or sfacctd; examples 
   and commandlines in this document will focus on pmacctd but pnrg's behaviour
   isn't somehow related to the daemon). contribs/pmacctd-nrg.conf is a sample
   configuration. pnrg expects to get data by reading /tmp/pmacct_in.pipe and
   /tmp/pmacct_out.pipe sockets. 

   shell> /usr/local/sbin/pmacctd -f /usr/local/pnrg/contribs/pmacctd-nrg.conf

c) insert pnrg's wrapper script in your crontab, executing each five minutes. 
   It will automatically create RRD, CGI, DESC and corollary HTML files for you.

   */5 * * * * ( cd /usr/local/pnrg/; ./pnrg-wrapper.sh )

d) It's time to configure your Apache. These instructions are OK if you have 
   just downloaded and installed a vanilla Apache 2 distribution - under the
   usual /usr/local/apache2 tree. Add the following section to your httpd.conf
   file and make the web server to load the new configuration:

   <Directory /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/pnrg>
   	Options Indexes ExecCGI
        AllowOverride None
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
   </Directory>

   Then, symbolic link the following locations:

   shell> ln -s /usr/local/pnrg/spool /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/pnrg

e) That's it. Now, wait a few minutes, get a cup of coffee and point your web
   browser to http://host/pnrg . If your pmacct daemon collected some traffic
   in the meanwhile, you should see appearing the "AutoDiscovery" tree in the
   lateral menu. Uncompress such tree, browse, play and enjoy!


3. Customizing the package

a) Many paths are hardcoded. This will hopefully change in the future. If you
   need to change any of the default paths, the best way to do it is grepping
   them through the source code, ie.

   shell> grep -R /usr/local/rrdtool * 
   shell> grep -R /usr/local *
   shell> grep /tmp/pmacct_ *

b) Keeping all discovered entries under the "AutoDiscovery" tree is not ideal.
   Editing the specific DESC files in the spool directory is the proper way to 
   logically group set of entries in distinct sub-folders. Currently, multiple
   folding levels are not supported; once again, hopefully, this will change.
