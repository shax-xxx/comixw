* Create an automatic sub-foldering mechanism to be applied to the spool directory in
  order to scatter entries among multiple dirs. Such mechanism should not be tailored
  to work only with IP addresses (as. graphed resources may include MAC addresses, AS
  numbers, tags, etc.)

* Improve the logical sub-foldering mechanism actually in place in pnrg-indexmaker.pl
  as it should allow for an arbitrary number of nestings.

* Remove hardcodings, introducing better flexibility, bearing in mind that one of the
  objectives of this project it to avoid complicating excessively package usability by
  from an end-user perspective. 

* Themes: the actual package layout is hopefully "cozy". Someone might like the whole
  project idea but is looking for something more sober and professional.  

* Templates. Related to the previous point, but more generic. Themes could be intended
  as layout templates. Templatizing a whole package is an art. This is a priority goal
  of the project. At some stage in the future. Hopefully, near future.
