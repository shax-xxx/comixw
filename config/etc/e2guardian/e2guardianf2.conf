# DansGuardian filter group config file for version 2.9.9.2


# Filter group mode
# This option determines whether members of this group have their web access
# unfiltered, filtered, or banned. This mechanism replaces the "banneduserlist"
# and "exceptionuserlist" files from previous versions.
#
# 0 = banned
# 1 = filtered
# 2 = unfiltered (exception)
#
# Only filter groups with a mode of 1 need to define phrase, URL, site, extension,
# mimetype and PICS lists; in other modes, these options are ignored to conserve
# memory.
#
# Defaults to 0 if unspecified.
# Unauthenticated users are treated as being in the first filter group.
groupmode = 2

# Filter group name
# Used to fill in the -FILTERGROUP- placeholder in the HTML template file, and to
# name the group in the access logs
# Defaults to empty string
groupname = 'unlimited group'

# reportinglevel
#
# -1 = log, but do not block - Stealth mode
#  0 = just say 'Access Denied'
#  1 = report why but not what denied phrase
#  2 = report fully
#  3 = use HTML template file (accessdeniedaddress ignored) - recommended
#
# If defined, this overrides the global setting in e2guardian.conf for
# members of this filter group.
#
reportinglevel = 3

# POST protection (web upload and forms)
# does not block forms without any file upload, i.e. this is just for
# blocking or limiting uploads
# measured in kibibytes after MIME encoding and header bumph
# use 0 for a complete block
# use higher (e.g. 512 = 512Kbytes) for limiting
# use -1 for no blocking
#maxuploadsize = 512
#maxuploadsize = 0
maxuploadsize = 1
