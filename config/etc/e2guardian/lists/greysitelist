#domains in grey list
#Don't bother with the www. or the http://

#The 'grey' lists override the 'banned' lists.
#The 'exception' lists override the 'banned' lists also.
#The difference is that the 'exception' lists completely switch
#off *all* other filtering for the match.  'grey' lists only
#stop the URL filtering and allow the normal filtering to work.

#An example of grey list use is when in Blanket Block (whitelist)
#mode and you want to allow some sites but still filter as normal
#on their content

#Another example of grey list use is when you ban a site but want
#to allow part of it.

#The greyurllist is for partly unblocking PART of a site
#The greysitelist is for partly unblocking ALL of a site

#As of e2guardian 2.7.3 you can now include
#.tld so for example you can match .gov for example

#To include additional files in this list use this example:
## .Include</etc/e2guardian/anotherurllist>

#You can have multiple #.Includes.

# Time limiting syntax:
# #time: <start hour> <start minute> <end hour> <end minute> <days>
# Example:
##time: 9 0 17 0 01234
# Remove the first # from the line above to enable this list only from
# 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.


# Blanket match.  To greylist all sites except those in the
# exceptionsitelist and greysitelist files, remove
# the # from the next line to leave only a '**':
#**

# Blanket SSL/CONNECT match.  To greylist all SSL 
# and CONNECT tunnels except to addresses in the
# exceptionsitelist and greysitelist files, remove
# the # from the next line to leave only a '**s':
#**s

# Blanket IP match.  To greylist all sites specified only as an IP,
# remove the # from the next line to leave only a '*ip':
#*ip

# Blanket SSL/CONNECT IP match.  To greylist all SSL and CONNECT
# tunnels to sites specified only as an IP,
# remove the # from the next line to leave only a '*ips':
#*ips
