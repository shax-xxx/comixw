# DansGuardian filter group config file for version 2.9.9.2


# Filter group mode
# This option determines whether members of this group have their web access
# unfiltered, filtered, or banned. This mechanism replaces the "banneduserlist"
# and "exceptionuserlist" files from previous versions.
#
# 0 = banned
# 1 = filtered
# 2 = unfiltered (exception)
#
# Only filter groups with a mode of 1 need to define phrase, URL, site, extension,
# mimetype and PICS lists; in other modes, these options are ignored to conserve
# memory.
#
# Defaults to 0 if unspecified.
# Unauthenticated users are treated as being in the first filter group.
groupmode = 2

# Filter group name
# Used to fill in the -FILTERGROUP- placeholder in the HTML template file, and to
# name the group in the access logs
# Defaults to empty string
groupname = 'unlimited group'
