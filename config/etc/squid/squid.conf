access_log /var/squid/logs/access.log squid

#  TAG: client_netmask
#	A netmask for client addresses in logfiles and cachemgr output.
#	Change this to protect the privacy of your cache clients.
#	A netmask of 255.255.255.0 will log all IP's in that range with
#	the last digit set to '0'.
#
#Default:
#client_netmask 255.255.255.255

#  TAG: debug_options
#	Logging options are set as section,level where each source file
#	is assigned a unique section.  Lower levels result in less
#	output,  Full debugging (level 9) can result in a very large
#	log file, so be careful.  The magic word "ALL" sets debugging
#	levels for all sections.  We recommend normally running with
#	"ALL,1".
#
#Default:
debug_options ALL,1

# Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
coredump_dir /var/squid/cache

#  TAG: cache
#	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, cause the request to
#	not be satisfied from the cache and the reply to not be cached.
#	In other words, use this to force certain objects to never be cached.
#
#	You must use the word 'DENY' to indicate the ACL names which should
#	NOT be cached.
#
#	Default is to allow all to be cached.
#
#Default:
# none
#no_cache deny localhost

#
# Add any of your own refresh_pattern entries above these.

refresh_pattern ^gopher:	1440	0%	1440
refresh_pattern -i (/cgi-bin/|\?) 0	0%	0
refresh_pattern .		0	20%	4320

#  TAG: cache_mgr
#	Email-address of local cache manager who will receive
#	mail if the cache dies. The default is "webmaster".
#
#Default:
#cache_mgr root@localhost

#  TAG: logfile_rotate
#       Specifies the number of logfile rotations to make when you
#       type 'squid -k rotate'. The default is 10, which will rotate
#       with extensions 0 through 9. Setting logfile_rotate to 0 will
#       disable the file name rotation, but the logfiles are still closed
#       and re-opened. This will enable you to rename the logfiles
#       yourself just before sending the rotate signal.
#       If you set logfile_rotate to 0, Squid simply closes and then re-opens the logs. 
#       This allows third-party logfile management systems, such as newsyslog, to maintain the log files. 
logfile_rotate 0

#Default:
dns_v4_first on
